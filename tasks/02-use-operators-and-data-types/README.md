02) Coding-Task: Use operators & data types
Prepare
 Create a new folder and prepare an index.html file that executes a script.js files.
01) Write a String that logs out your first name
 Use the concatenation operator to concatenate each letter of your firstname into a string one letter by one.

 Copy the following code snippets to the script.js file and try to spot and fix the errors.
// Error! Make it work
console.log("Hallo";
// Error! Make it work
console.log("That doesn"t work");
// should return true. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log(50 + 2 > 52);
// should be false. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log("333" == 333);
// Wrong result: Expected 555 not 855. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log(600 + 510 / 2);
// Wrong result: Expected a Number 4 received 22
console.log("2" + 2);
03) Compare two conditions
 Create a console.log that returns true when both division results are equal to 5
console.log(25 / 5); // Result: 5
console.log(50 / 10); // Result: 5
